## 🎯 Overview

The Alpha Scanner implements a **multi-factor quantitative strategy** designed to identify asymmetric risk/reward opportunities in liquid US stocks. The strategy combines trend-following, momentum, volume, and volatility analysis to generate high-probability trading signals with defined risk parameters.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Asymmetric Risk/Reward**: Target 3:1 and 5:1 reward-to-risk ratios
2. **Probability-Based Scoring**: Convert technical signals into probability estimates
3. **Mechanical Execution**: Remove emotion with systematic rules
4. **Strict Risk Management**: Fixed risk per trade with position sizing
5. **Continuous Calibration**: Track outcomes to validate signal accuracy

## 📐 Technical Indicators & Feature Computation

**Implementation:** `apps/api/app/services/scanner.py` → `compute_features()`

### 1. Trend Analysis (EMA System)

**Exponential Moving Averages:**
```python
EMA_PERIODS = {
    "fast": 20,    # Short-term trend
    "medium": 50,  # Intermediate trend
    "slow": 200    # Long-term trend / major support
}
```

**Calculated Features:**
- `ema_20`, `ema_50`, `ema_200`: Exponential moving averages
- `ema_alignment_bull`: Boolean flag when EMA20 > EMA50 > EMA200
- `price_vs_ema20_pct`: Current price distance from EMA20 as percentage
- `ema20_vs_ema50_pct`: EMA20 distance from EMA50 (momentum strength)

**Why EMA?**
- More responsive to recent price action than SMA
- Reduces lag while maintaining smooth trend identification
- Industry standard for swing trading timeframes

### 2. Momentum Indicators

**RSI (Relative Strength Index):**
```python
RSI_PERIOD = 14  # Standard Wilder's RSI
```

**Calculated Features:**
- `rsi_14`: 14-period RSI (0-100 scale)
- **Optimal Range**: 45-65 (not oversold, not overbought)
- **Avoid**: <30 (oversold, potential downtrend) or >70 (overbought, potential reversal)

**VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):**
```python
vwap = sum(price * volume) / sum(volume)
```

**Calculated Features:**
- `vwap_distance_pct`: Current price distance from VWAP
- **Signal**: Price near/above VWAP indicates institutional support

### 3. Volume Analysis

**Relative Volume (RVOL):**
```python
current_volume = today's volume
avg_volume_20d = 20-day average volume
rvol = current_volume / avg_volume_20d
```

**Calculated Features:**
- `rvol`: Relative volume ratio (typically 0.5 - 3.0)
- `volume_sma_20`: 20-day average volume baseline
- **Threshold**: RVOL > 1.5 indicates significant interest

**Average Daily Dollar Volume (ADDV):**
```python
ADDV = avg_volume_20d * current_price
ADDV_MIN_USD = 5_000_000  # $5M minimum
```

**Purpose:** Ensures sufficient liquidity for entry/exit without slippage

### 4. Volatility Metrics

**Average True Range (ATR):**
```python
ATR_PERIOD = 14  # Standard Wilder's ATR
true_range = max(high - low, abs(high - prev_close), abs(low - prev_close))
atr = ema(true_range, period=14)
```

**Calculated Features:**
- `atr`: Absolute ATR value in dollars
- `atr_percent`: ATR as percentage of price (key metric)
- **Optimal Range**: 2-6% (predictable volatility, not too choppy)

**Bollinger Bands:**
```python
BB_PERIOD = 20
BB_STD = 2.0  # Standard deviations
middle = SMA(close, 20)
upper = middle + (2 * stdev)
lower = middle - (2 * stdev)
bb_position = (close - lower) / (upper - lower)  # %B
```

**Calculated Features:**
- `bb_width`: Band width as % of price
- `bb_position`: Current position within bands (0-1 scale)

### 5. Market Microstructure

**Bid-Ask Spread:**
```python
spread_bps = ((ask - bid) / bid) * 10000
MAX_SPREAD_BPS = 25  # 0.25% maximum
```

**Purpose:** Filter out illiquid stocks with high transaction costs

---

## 🎲 Signal Scoring System

**Implementation:** `apps/api/app/services/scanner.py` → `score_features()`

### Scoring Formula (0-100 scale)

The overall signal score is a **weighted combination** of four sub-scores:

```
Signal Score = (Price Score × 0.40) + 
               (Volume Score × 0.30) + 
               (Volatility Score × 0.30)
```

Each sub-score is calculated on a 0-10 scale, then the weighted sum is multiplied by 10 to get 0-100.

---

### 1. Price Score (0-10) - Weight: 40%

**Components:**

#### A. Trend Alignment (4.0 points max)
```python
if ema_alignment_bull:  # EMA20 > EMA50 > EMA200
    price_score += 4.0
```

#### B. Price Position vs EMA20 (3.0 points max)
```python
price_vs_ema20 = (current_price - ema_20) / ema_20

if price_vs_ema20 > 0.02:      # >2% above EMA20
    price_score += 3.0
elif price_vs_ema20 > 0.005:   # >0.5% above EMA20
    price_score += 1.5
elif price_vs_ema20 < -0.02:   # >2% below EMA20
    price_score += 0.5
```

#### C. RSI Momentum (3.0 points max)
```python
rsi = features["rsi_14"]

if 45 <= rsi <= 65:  # Sweet spot
    price_score += 3.0
elif 40 <= rsi < 45 or 65 < rsi <= 70:  # Acceptable
    price_score += 1.5
elif rsi < 30:  # Oversold (avoid)
    price_score += 0.0
elif rsi > 80:  # Extremely overbought (avoid)
    price_score += 0.0
```

**Maximum Price Score:** 10.0 points

---

### 2. Volume Score (0-10) - Weight: 30%

**Components:**

#### A. Relative Volume (6.0 points max)
```python
rvol = features["rvol"]

if rvol >= 2.0:     # 2x average volume
    volume_score += 6.0
elif rvol >= 1.5:   # 1.5x average volume
    volume_score += 4.0
elif rvol >= 1.2:   # 1.2x average volume
    volume_score += 2.0
elif rvol < 0.7:    # Below average (avoid)
    volume_score += 0.0
```

#### B. VWAP Position (4.0 points max)
```python
vwap_distance = features["vwap_distance_pct"]

if -0.005 <= vwap_distance <= 0.02:  # Near/above VWAP
    volume_score += 4.0
elif vwap_distance > 0.02:            # Extended above
    volume_score += 2.0
elif vwap_distance < -0.02:           # Below VWAP
    volume_score += 1.0
```

**Maximum Volume Score:** 10.0 points

---

### 3. Volatility Score (0-10) - Weight: 30%

**Components:**

#### A. ATR Suitability (7.0 points max)
```python
atr_percent = features["atr_percent"]

if 2.0 <= atr_percent <= 6.0:  # Ideal range
    volatility_score += 7.0
elif 1.5 <= atr_percent < 2.0 or 6.0 < atr_percent <= 8.0:  # Acceptable
    volatility_score += 4.0
elif atr_percent > 10.0:       # Too volatile
    volatility_score += 1.0
elif atr_percent < 1.0:        # Too quiet
    volatility_score += 2.0
```

#### B. Bollinger Band Position (3.0 points max)
```python
bb_position = features["bb_position"]

if 0.3 <= bb_position <= 0.7:  # Middle of bands (stable)
    volatility_score += 3.0
elif 0.2 <= bb_position < 0.3 or 0.7 < bb_position <= 0.8:  # Near edges
    volatility_score += 1.5
elif bb_position > 0.9 or bb_position < 0.1:  # Extreme (avoid)
    volatility_score += 0.0
```

**Maximum Volatility Score:** 10.0 points

---

### Final Signal Score Calculation

```python
# Each sub-score is 0-10
overall_score = (
    (price_score * 0.40) +      # 40% weight
    (volume_score * 0.30) +     # 30% weight
    (volatility_score * 0.30)   # 30% weight
) * 10  # Scale to 0-100

# Example:
# Price: 8.5, Volume: 7.0, Volatility: 6.5
# Signal Score = (8.5*0.4 + 7.0*0.3 + 6.5*0.3) * 10 = 73.0
```

### Signal Interpretation

| Score Range | Classification | Action |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| 0-34 | No Signal | Filtered out, not shown |
| 35-49 | Weak Signal | Monitor, low conviction |
| 50-59 | Moderate Signal | Consider with caution |
| 60-74 | Strong Signal | High conviction opportunity |
| 75-100 | Premium Signal | Highest quality setups |

## 💰 Trade Setup Generation

**Implementation:** `apps/api/app/services/scanner.py` → `generate_trade_setup()`

### Entry Price
```python
entry_price = current_market_price  # No limit orders, take current price
```

### Stop Loss
```python
STOP_MULTIPLIER = 1.5
stop_loss = entry_price - (STOP_MULTIPLIER * atr)
```

**Rationale:** 1.5x ATR gives breathing room while limiting downside

### Target Prices
```python
risk_per_share = entry_price - stop_loss

target_1 = entry_price + (3.0 * risk_per_share)  # 3R
target_2 = entry_price + (5.0 * risk_per_share)  # 5R
```

**Exit Strategy (recommended):**
- Exit 50% position at Target 1 (3R)
- Let remaining 50% run to Target 2 (5R) or trail stop

### Position Sizing
```python
RISK_PCT_PER_TRADE = 0.005  # 0.5% account risk
account_value = 100000  # Example
max_loss_usd = account_value * RISK_PCT_PER_TRADE  # $500

risk_per_share = entry_price - stop_loss
position_size_shares = max_loss_usd / risk_per_share

# Example:
# Entry: $100, Stop: $95, Risk/share: $5
# Position: $500 / $5 = 100 shares
# Max loss: 100 shares × $5 = $500 (0.5% of account)
```

## 🛡️ Guardrails & Safety Filters

**Implementation:** `apps/api/app/services/scanner.py` → `check_guardrails()`

### Liquidity Filter
```python
ADDV_MIN_USD = 5_000_000  # $5M minimum daily dollar volume

if avg_volume_20d * price < ADDV_MIN_USD:
    status = "BLOCKED"
    reason = "Insufficient liquidity"
```

### Spread Filter
```python
MAX_SPREAD_BPS = 25  # 0.25% maximum

bid_ask_spread = ((ask - bid) / bid) * 10000
if bid_ask_spread > MAX_SPREAD_BPS:
    status = "BLOCKED"
    reason = "Excessive bid-ask spread"
```

### Net Expected R Filter
```python
p_target = score_to_probability(signal_score)  # Convert score to probability
rr_ratio = (target_1 - entry) / (entry - stop)  # Usually 3.0
costs_r = slippage_bps + fees in R-multiples

net_expected_r = (p_target * rr_ratio) - ((1 - p_target) * 1.0) - costs_r

if net_expected_r <= 0:
    status = "BLOCKED"
    reason = "Negative expected value"
```

### Price Range Filter
```python
MIN_PRICE = 5.0     # Avoid penny stocks
MAX_PRICE = 500.0   # Avoid expensive outliers

if not (MIN_PRICE <= price <= MAX_PRICE):
    status = "BLOCKED"
    reason = "Price outside acceptable range"
```

### Guardrail Status Levels

- **APPROVED**: All filters passed, ready to trade
- **REVIEW**: Minor concerns, requires manual review
- **BLOCKED**: Failed critical filter, do not trade

## 📈 Probability Calibration

**Implementation:** `apps/api/app/services/scanner.py` → `score_to_probability()`

### Score → Probability Mapping

```python
def score_to_probability(signal_score: float) -> float:
    """
    Convert signal score (0-100) to probability of reaching target (0-1).
    
    Uses a sigmoid-like curve:
    - Score 35 (minimum) → ~40% probability
    - Score 50 (moderate) → ~50% probability
    - Score 65 (strong) → ~60% probability
    - Score 80 (premium) → ~70% probability
    """
    # Normalized sigmoid function
    x = (signal_score - 50) / 20  # Center at 50, scale by 20
    p = 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))
    
    # Adjust baseline to 40-70% range
    p_target = 0.40 + (p * 0.30)
    
    return max(0.40, min(0.70, p_target))
```

**Rationale:**
- Conservative estimates (40-70% range)
- Requires tracking actual outcomes to calibrate
- Prevents over-optimistic probability assignments

---

## 🔄 Free Tier Optimizations

**Implementation:** `apps/api/app/services/scanner.py` → `scan_opportunities()`

### Watchlist-Based Scanning
```python
POLYGON_WATCHLIST = [
    "AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "TSLA", "NVDA",
    "META", "AMZN", "AMD", "NFLX", "UBER"
]
```

**Customization:** Edit `apps/api/app/core/config.py` to modify watchlist

### Rate Limiting (Polygon Free Tier)
```python
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 12.0  # 12 seconds between API calls
# = 5 requests per minute (Polygon free tier limit)
```

### Result Caching
```python
_CACHE_TTL_HOURS = 12  # Cache scan results for 12 hours

# Data updates end-of-day anyway (free tier constraint)
# Subsequent scans within 12h return cached results instantly
```

### Scan Performance
- **Initial Scan**: ~2 minutes (10 symbols × 12s delay)
- **Cached Scan**: <100ms (instant)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ~95% during market hours

## 🎓 Strategy Evolution & Calibration

### Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Track All Signals**: Use Signal History table to log outcomes
2. **Measure Calibration**: Compare predicted probabilities vs actual win rates
3. **Adjust Mapping**: Refine `score_to_probability()` based on real data
4. **Iterate Scoring**: Reweight factors based on predictive power

### Calibration Gate (before live trading)
```
|Predicted P - Actual Win Rate| ≤ 10%

Example:
Signals scored 60-70 predict 55-65% probability
Actual win rate of these signals: 58%
Calibration error: |60% - 58%| = 2% ✅ PASS
```
