# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Crypto Mode with Polygon API Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Add comprehensive cryptocurrency scanning capabilities using Polygon REST Crypto APIs with 24/7 trading support, crypto-specific volatility bands, and exchange-aggregated volume analysis.
# Details:
Implement a complete crypto trading mode that extends the existing scanner architecture:

1. **API Integration**: Integrate Polygon REST Crypto APIs for real-time and historical cryptocurrency data, including price feeds, volume data, and market statistics across multiple exchanges.

2. **UI Asset Toggle**: Add a prominent crypto/stock mode toggle in the main UI that switches between traditional equity scanning and cryptocurrency scanning modes, with clear visual indicators of the active mode.

3. **24/7 Trading Adaptation**: Modify the scanner's time-based logic to handle continuous cryptocurrency markets, removing market hours restrictions and adjusting alert timing for round-the-clock operation.

4. **Crypto-Specific Parameters**:
   - Adjust volatility bands for higher crypto volatility (wider percentage ranges)
   - Modify RVOL (Relative Volume) calculations for crypto's different volume patterns
   - Implement crypto-appropriate price movement thresholds
   - Add support for cryptocurrency-specific metrics (market cap, circulating supply)

5. **Liquidity Heuristics**: Implement exchange-aggregated volume analysis using Polygon's multi-exchange data to ensure accurate liquidity measurements across different crypto exchanges.

6. **Core Feature Reuse**: Leverage existing scanner infrastructure, alert systems, and user preference management while applying crypto-specific configurations and thresholds.

7. **Guardrails**: Implement crypto-specific risk management including volatility warnings, liquidity checks, and market manipulation detection adapted for crypto markets.

8. **Configuration Management**: Create separate configuration profiles for crypto vs equity scanning with appropriate default values and user customization options.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing approach:

1. **API Integration Tests**: Verify Polygon Crypto API connectivity, data accuracy, and error handling for various cryptocurrency symbols and market conditions.

2. **UI Toggle Testing**: Test seamless switching between crypto and equity modes, ensuring proper state management and UI updates.

3. **24/7 Operation Tests**: Run extended tests during traditional market closed hours to verify continuous crypto scanning functionality.

4. **Parameter Validation**: Test crypto-specific volatility bands, RVOL calculations, and threshold adjustments against known crypto market scenarios.

5. **Volume Aggregation Tests**: Validate exchange-aggregated volume calculations using multiple crypto exchanges and compare against expected results.

6. **Performance Testing**: Ensure crypto mode maintains acceptable performance with potentially higher data volumes and continuous operation.

7. **Integration Tests**: Verify that existing core features (alerts, preferences, guardrails) work correctly in crypto mode.

8. **Edge Case Testing**: Test handling of crypto-specific scenarios like extreme volatility, low-volume altcoins, and exchange outages.

9. **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct testing with crypto traders to validate usability and effectiveness of crypto-specific features.

10. **Documentation Review**: Verify all crypto features are properly documented with usage examples and configuration guidance.
