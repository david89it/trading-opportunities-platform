# Task ID: 2
# Title: Finalize Visa Design System Integration (Nova Styles)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive Visa Nova design system integration across the web application, including color palette mapping, typography scales, spacing tokens, and component styling with accessibility compliance.
# Details:
Complete the Visa Design System (Nova) integration across all web application components:

1. **Color Palette Implementation**: 
   - Map all existing colors to Nova color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, semantic colors)
   - Update CSS custom properties and design tokens file
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
   - Implement dark/light theme variants if applicable

2. **Typography System**:
   - Apply Nova typography scales (heading levels, body text, captions)
   - Update font families, weights, and line heights
   - Implement responsive typography using Nova's fluid type scales
   - Ensure proper font loading and fallbacks

3. **Spacing and Layout Tokens**:
   - Replace hardcoded spacing values with Nova spacing tokens
   - Update margins, padding, and gap properties throughout components
   - Implement consistent grid system and breakpoints

4. **Component Styling Updates**:
   - **Buttons**: Apply Nova button styles, variants (primary, secondary, tertiary), sizes, and states
   - **Surfaces**: Update card, modal, and container styling with proper elevation and borders
   - **Tables**: Implement Nova table styling including headers, rows, zebra striping, and responsive behavior

5. **Interactive States**:
   - Ensure all hover states are readable and meet accessibility standards
   - Implement consistent focus outlines using Nova focus ring styles
   - Update active and disabled states across all interactive elements

6. **Documentation**:
   - Create brief migration guide documenting key changes
   - Update component documentation with new Nova styling
   - Document any custom overrides or exceptions needed

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing approach for design system integration:

1. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Take screenshots of all major UI components before and after integration
   - Use visual diff tools to identify unintended changes
   - Test across different browsers and screen sizes

2. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Run automated accessibility scans (axe-core, WAVE)
   - Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Test keyboard navigation and focus indicators
   - Validate screen reader compatibility

3. **Interactive State Testing**:
   - Test all hover states for readability and visual feedback
   - Verify focus outlines are visible and consistent across all interactive elements
   - Test active and disabled states for buttons and form controls

4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify font rendering and spacing consistency
   - Test responsive behavior at various breakpoints

5. **Component Integration Testing**:
   - Verify buttons work correctly in different contexts (forms, modals, toolbars)
   - Test table functionality including sorting, filtering, and responsive behavior
   - Ensure surfaces (cards, modals) display correctly with new styling

6. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure CSS bundle size impact
   - Test font loading performance
   - Verify no layout shifts during style application

7. **Documentation Review**:
   - Validate migration guide accuracy
   - Ensure all documented changes are implemented correctly
   - Review component documentation for completeness
