        "title": "Implement Crypto Mode with Polygon API Integration",
        "description": "Add comprehensive cryptocurrency scanning capabilities using Polygon REST Crypto APIs with 24/7 trading support, crypto-specific volatility bands, and exchange-aggregated volume analysis.",
        "details": "Implement a complete crypto trading mode that extends the existing scanner architecture:\n\n1. **API Integration**: Integrate Polygon REST Crypto APIs for real-time and historical cryptocurrency data, including price feeds, volume data, and market statistics across multiple exchanges.\n\n2. **UI Asset Toggle**: Add a prominent crypto/stock mode toggle in the main UI that switches between traditional equity scanning and cryptocurrency scanning modes, with clear visual indicators of the active mode.\n\n3. **24/7 Trading Adaptation**: Modify the scanner's time-based logic to handle continuous cryptocurrency markets, removing market hours restrictions and adjusting alert timing for round-the-clock operation.\n\n4. **Crypto-Specific Parameters**:\n   - Adjust volatility bands for higher crypto volatility (wider percentage ranges)\n   - Modify RVOL (Relative Volume) calculations for crypto's different volume patterns\n   - Implement crypto-appropriate price movement thresholds\n   - Add support for cryptocurrency-specific metrics (market cap, circulating supply)\n\n5. **Liquidity Heuristics**: Implement exchange-aggregated volume analysis using Polygon's multi-exchange data to ensure accurate liquidity measurements across different crypto exchanges.\n\n6. **Core Feature Reuse**: Leverage existing scanner infrastructure, alert systems, and user preference management while applying crypto-specific configurations and thresholds.\n\n7. **Guardrails**: Implement crypto-specific risk management including volatility warnings, liquidity checks, and market manipulation detection adapted for crypto markets.\n\n8. **Configuration Management**: Create separate configuration profiles for crypto vs equity scanning with appropriate default values and user customization options.",
        "testStrategy": "Comprehensive testing approach:\n\n1. **API Integration Tests**: Verify Polygon Crypto API connectivity, data accuracy, and error handling for various cryptocurrency symbols and market conditions.\n\n2. **UI Toggle Testing**: Test seamless switching between crypto and equity modes, ensuring proper state management and UI updates.\n\n3. **24/7 Operation Tests**: Run extended tests during traditional market closed hours to verify continuous crypto scanning functionality.\n\n4. **Parameter Validation**: Test crypto-specific volatility bands, RVOL calculations, and threshold adjustments against known crypto market scenarios.\n\n5. **Volume Aggregation Tests**: Validate exchange-aggregated volume calculations using multiple crypto exchanges and compare against expected results.\n\n6. **Performance Testing**: Ensure crypto mode maintains acceptable performance with potentially higher data volumes and continuous operation.\n\n7. **Integration Tests**: Verify that existing core features (alerts, preferences, guardrails) work correctly in crypto mode.\n\n8. **Edge Case Testing**: Test handling of crypto-specific scenarios like extreme volatility, low-volume altcoins, and exchange outages.\n\n9. **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct testing with crypto traders to validate usability and effectiveness of crypto-specific features.\n\n10. **Documentation Review**: Verify all crypto features are properly documented with usage examples and configuration guidance.",

        "description": "Implement comprehensive Visa Nova design system integration across the web application, including color palette mapping, typography scales, spacing tokens, and component styling with accessibility compliance.",
        "details": "Complete the Visa Design System (Nova) integration across all web application components:\n\n1. **Color Palette Implementation**: \n   - Map all existing colors to Nova color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, semantic colors)\n   - Update CSS custom properties and design tokens file\n   - Ensure proper contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards\n   - Implement dark/light theme variants if applicable\n\n2. **Typography System**:\n   - Apply Nova typography scales (heading levels, body text, captions)\n   - Update font families, weights, and line heights\n   - Implement responsive typography using Nova's fluid type scales\n   - Ensure proper font loading and fallbacks\n\n3. **Spacing and Layout Tokens**:\n   - Replace hardcoded spacing values with Nova spacing tokens\n   - Update margins, padding, and gap properties throughout components\n   - Implement consistent grid system and breakpoints\n\n4. **Component Styling Updates**:\n   - **Buttons**: Apply Nova button styles, variants (primary, secondary, tertiary), sizes, and states\n   - **Surfaces**: Update card, modal, and container styling with proper elevation and borders\n   - **Tables**: Implement Nova table styling including headers, rows, zebra striping, and responsive behavior\n\n5. **Interactive States**:\n   - Ensure all hover states are readable and meet accessibility standards\n   - Implement consistent focus outlines using Nova focus ring styles\n   - Update active and disabled states across all interactive elements\n\n6. **Documentation**:\n   - Create brief migration guide documenting key changes\n   - Update component documentation with new Nova styling\n   - Document any custom overrides or exceptions needed",
        "testStrategy": "Comprehensive testing approach for design system integration:\n\n1. **Visual Regression Testing**:\n   - Take screenshots of all major UI components before and after integration\n   - Use visual diff tools to identify unintended changes\n   - Test across different browsers and screen sizes\n\n2. **Accessibility Testing**:\n   - Run automated accessibility scans (axe-core, WAVE)\n   - Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)\n   - Test keyboard navigation and focus indicators\n   - Validate screen reader compatibility\n\n3. **Interactive State Testing**:\n   - Test all hover states for readability and visual feedback\n   - Verify focus outlines are visible and consistent across all interactive elements\n   - Test active and disabled states for buttons and form controls\n\n4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:\n   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge\n   - Verify font rendering and spacing consistency\n   - Test responsive behavior at various breakpoints\n\n5. **Component Integration Testing**:\n   - Verify buttons work correctly in different contexts (forms, modals, toolbars)\n   - Test table functionality including sorting, filtering, and responsive behavior\n   - Ensure surfaces (cards, modals) display correctly with new styling\n\n6. **Performance Testing**:\n   - Measure CSS bundle size impact\n   - Test font loading performance\n   - Verify no layout shifts during style application\n\n7. **Documentation Review**:\n   - Validate migration guide accuracy\n   - Ensure all documented changes are implemented correctly\n   - Review component documentation for completeness",
