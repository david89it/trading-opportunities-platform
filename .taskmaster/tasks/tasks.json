        "description": "Add comprehensive cryptocurrency scanning capabilities using Polygon REST Crypto APIs with 24/7 trading support, crypto-specific volatility bands, and exchange-aggregated volume analysis.",
        "details": "Implement a complete crypto trading mode that extends the existing scanner architecture:\n\n1. **API Integration**: Integrate Polygon REST Crypto APIs for real-time and historical cryptocurrency data, including price feeds, volume data, and market statistics across multiple exchanges.\n\n2. **UI Asset Toggle**: Add a prominent crypto/stock mode toggle in the main UI that switches between traditional equity scanning and cryptocurrency scanning modes, with clear visual indicators of the active mode.\n\n3. **24/7 Trading Adaptation**: Modify the scanner's time-based logic to handle continuous cryptocurrency markets, removing market hours restrictions and adjusting alert timing for round-the-clock operation.\n\n4. **Crypto-Specific Parameters**:\n   - Adjust volatility bands for higher crypto volatility (wider percentage ranges)\n   - Modify RVOL (Relative Volume) calculations for crypto's different volume patterns\n   - Implement crypto-appropriate price movement thresholds\n   - Add support for cryptocurrency-specific metrics (market cap, circulating supply)\n\n5. **Liquidity Heuristics**: Implement exchange-aggregated volume analysis using Polygon's multi-exchange data to ensure accurate liquidity measurements across different crypto exchanges.\n\n6. **Core Feature Reuse**: Leverage existing scanner infrastructure, alert systems, and user preference management while applying crypto-specific configurations and thresholds.\n\n7. **Guardrails**: Implement crypto-specific risk management including volatility warnings, liquidity checks, and market manipulation detection adapted for crypto markets.\n\n8. **Configuration Management**: Create separate configuration profiles for crypto vs equity scanning with appropriate default values and user customization options.",
        "testStrategy": "Comprehensive testing approach:\n\n1. **API Integration Tests**: Verify Polygon Crypto API connectivity, data accuracy, and error handling for various cryptocurrency symbols and market conditions.\n\n2. **UI Toggle Testing**: Test seamless switching between crypto and equity modes, ensuring proper state management and UI updates.\n\n3. **24/7 Operation Tests**: Run extended tests during traditional market closed hours to verify continuous crypto scanning functionality.\n\n4. **Parameter Validation**: Test crypto-specific volatility bands, RVOL calculations, and threshold adjustments against known crypto market scenarios.\n\n5. **Volume Aggregation Tests**: Validate exchange-aggregated volume calculations using multiple crypto exchanges and compare against expected results.\n\n6. **Performance Testing**: Ensure crypto mode maintains acceptable performance with potentially higher data volumes and continuous operation.\n\n7. **Integration Tests**: Verify that existing core features (alerts, preferences, guardrails) work correctly in crypto mode.\n\n8. **Edge Case Testing**: Test handling of crypto-specific scenarios like extreme volatility, low-volume altcoins, and exchange outages.\n\n9. **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct testing with crypto traders to validate usability and effectiveness of crypto-specific features.\n\n10. **Documentation Review**: Verify all crypto features are properly documented with usage examples and configuration guidance.",
